# YourStory


## What does this app do:

The app will tell a story depending on what the user chooses and can be fleshed out and modified to provide an engaging story-telling experience.


## Goal

The goal of this challenge is to get comfortable with implementing the MVC design pattern and thinking about the state of the app. In addition, I reviewed the concept of Swift Structures and used it to separate the Model from the Controller.
